# GitTurkey Finished

Hello! In order to run this project, navigate to the `Codegen` directory and run the `swift run` command. 

You must also set valid values for the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` properties. You can generate your own by going into GitHub's Settings => Developer Settings => OAuth Apps. Create a new OAuth app and set the values. 

Once that command is finished, you can run this project as you would any other Xcode project.
